# CatSweeper

Android app created using Android Studio and coded in Java and XML. CatSweeper functions similarly to MineSweeper, but instead of mines, you are trying to avoid the sleeping cats and stars are used instead of flags. Like MineSweeper, I added a feature to make sure that the first click will never result in the player hitting a sleeping cat. If the tile the player first clicks on is a cat then the cat is moved to an adjacent tile or the first tile not already containing a sleeping cat from the upper left corner. In the future, I am considering adding different levels, a timer, a ranking system, better designs for icons, and sound/music. I am also considering uploading this app to the Google Play Store and creating an iOS version using Xcode with Swift.
